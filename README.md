# Titanic-dataset-Analysis
This dataset is a project on Titanic disaster.This projects aims to predict the survival rate of the passengers using a supervised machine learning model.
The project aims to use Logistic Regression Model with Scikit-learn to predict passengers that are more likely to survive based on given data like their age, gender, fare and class.
The notebook is into four sections ,with an end-to-end analysis of the dataset.This notebook is a detailed one as it includes all features of basic and simple Supervised Machine Learning.
The notebook also includes  visualization of passengers that survived and those that did not.This is to give a better understanding of the project.
